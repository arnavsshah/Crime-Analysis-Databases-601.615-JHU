How to run:

Install postgres and pgadmin (recommended). [This](https://www.tecmint.com/install-postgresql-and-pgadmin-in-ubuntu/) is a good resource for ubuntu.

Use the credentials in db.js or your own!
Run all queries in sql/create_queries.sql in the newly formed database.

Then, run the following commands to initialize and start the project.
```
npm install
npm start
```

Finally, go to http://localhost:3000 and play with the data!

*Add your data to the csv folder.
